# Guide

This guide and codebase is a companion resource for those reading [A Logical Calculus of the Ideas Immanent in Nervous Activity](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~./epxing/Class/10715/reading/McCulloch.and.Pitts.pdf) by [Warren McCulloch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_Sturgis_McCulloch) and [Walter Pitts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Pitts).

The guide annotates the paper section-by-section. I only quote directly from the paper when there is something to call out explicitly. When possible I bias towards a fully working implementation in code that the reader can use themselves.
